## Introduction
React application to convert grades from Polish or U.S grades system to GPA world system and 
compute grade point average according to formula from Stanford University.

## General info
Grades can be inserted manually or you can input a file with xls extension. 
- There is a need to have your grades under column named 
'Ocena' and the ECTS or hours value under column called 'ECTS'.
- Rest of columns do not affect the performance of the application.
- The columns' order does not matter.


Program accepts XLS files generated straight from JSOS ( 
for Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology Students).

Data Sample if you do not want to enter it manually:

### Data formating:
- Wrong rows like "---" are being omitted.
- Values from rows like '(E)' are taken into account.
